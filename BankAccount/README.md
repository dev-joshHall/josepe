####Bank Account Explaination###

8/21/2020
I made the BankAccount project as a way for me to demonstrate my learning to this point. I designed the whole thing, came up with the ideas for all aspects, and wrote the whole thing without mentoring.

I designed the GUI using Tkinter as a way for employers to view my work in an easy way. Not all aspects of my BankAccount objects can be simulated in the app (large amounts of time passing, people making remote purchases using the account, etc.).

At the moment this project is a work in progress.
