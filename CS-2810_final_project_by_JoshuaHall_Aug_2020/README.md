#Prime Detector Project

###CS 2810 Computer Organization and Architecture Final Project (Summer 2020)

###By Joshua Hall, UVU College of Engineering and Technology

The project is writen in LC-3 assembly language and is meant to demonstrate that I am capable of working with low-level 
programing and problem solving.

The visible code is available in the 'ASM Files' directory. To easily run the code, go to the simulator at 
https://wchargin.github.io/lc3web/ and select the upload button â®‰ then drag and drop the five object files from the 
'OBJ Files' directory into the provided space. After that, click 'process files'. If PC is not at x3000 press the 
buttons to 'reset all registers' and 'clear r0-r7'. Press 'run' and click into the console to enter input. Continue 
entering numbers (up to 4 digits) or enter a '0' to exit the program.
